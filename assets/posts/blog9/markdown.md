With the ending of one adventure, another begins.

I left Boston (which I will miss a lot), and my frat house residence (which I will not miss one bit), last Friday. My trip home was the usual mad-dash through Chicago, in which I attempt to pack as much as I possibly can in a short window.

I spent time with Amy, including celebrating her upcoming birthday. I saw my parents become empty nesters, dropping Cynthia off at school, and I stooped with the neighbors on Homer St.

And then, in an instant, I was gone. As we speak, I'm fighting jet lag in a coffee shop in Amsterdam. Trip #1, Country #1 on my European journey.

It's immediately obvious how young Amsterdam is. The style easily tops the fashionista culture in Montreal. I was born in Chicago, but I feel as naive and country as the Iowa crewneck I chose to don for my flight over. I have already identified a need for new pants, shoes, and jackets - now to hunt them down.

To get to my hostel in the north of Amsterdam, there's a series of three boats to ferry walkers and bikers across the river. I'd say these Europeans have never heard of a bridge before, but they appear on every other street. There must be some semblance of showing off involved, coupled with a need to leave the river open to taller boats.

I spent a day walking the north of Amsterdam, wandering aimlessly through the streets, looking for nice places to sit and read. Some time was spent sitting along the river, other time on the patio of a restaurant.

My final day in Holland I spent at the F1's Dutch GP. I misjudged the time it would take to reach Zandvoort from Amsterdam, so I showed up part of the way through free practice 3. Logan Sargent, the lone American driver on the grid, managed to crash early on - limiting the session to just a couple laps per driver.

The Dutch GP offers a general admission ticket, which provides access to the sand dunes just outside of the track. It would be a bad place to build any sort of grandstands, so instead they opened it up to a lower price point. It provided a unique view of the cars, as I was able to get within feet of the cars. At full speed, you must train your eye to identify the driver zooming past. Otherwise, it's just the sound of a roaring engine with a flash of color.

With qualifying wrapped up, and Lando on pole for Sunday's grand prix, I made the trek back to Amsterdam.

On to Helsinki!
