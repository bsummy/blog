With the ending of one adventure, another begins.

I left Boston (which I will miss a lot), and my frat house residence (which I will not miss one bit), last Friday. My trip home was the usual mad-dash through Chicago, in which I attempt to pack as much as I possibly can in a short window.

I spent time with Amy, including celebrating her upcoming birthday. I saw my parents become empty nesters, dropping Cynthia off at school, and I stooped with the neighbors on Homer St.

And then, in an instant, I was gone. As we speak, I'm fighting jet lag in a coffee shop in Amsterdam. Trip #1, Country #1 on my European journey.

It's immediately obvious how young Amsterdam is. The style easily tops the fashionista culture in Montreal. I was born in Chicago, but I feel as naive and country as the Iowa crewneck I chose to don for my flight over. I have already identified a need for new pants, shoes, and jackets - now to hunt them down.

To get to my hostel in the north of Amsterdam, there's a series of three boats to ferry walkers and bikers across the river. I'd say these Europeans have never heard of a bridge before, but they appear on every other street. There must be some semblance of showing off involved, coupled with a need to leave the river open to taller boats.

Today I am going to the Rijks museum, recommended by Henry's mom. She has a good history of recommendations - she had Henry bring me to the Montreal Orchestra for a Bach rendition.

Tomorrow is a day at the F1 Dutch Grand Prix weekend. Knowing how horrible the train of the Isle in Montreal, I'm interested to see how hard it'll be to grab a train back from Zandvoort.
