A couple years back, my good friend Owen and I would swap albums. I'd then respond with an album review. The reviews I wrote were brief, intentionally based on only one continuous listen. I'd note general impressions, favorite songs, and describe the artist as a blend of similar artists.

Once, Owen did suggest I start a music blog; **I believe this is something the world does not need in the slightest**. However, I do feel like it's a valuable once-off endeavour in writing and music.

Without further ado, I present my review of Childish Gambino's final album in an expanded format:

---

### **Bando Stone and The New World**

## Storyline

In a trailer posted to Gambino's youtube on June 30th, 2024, we learn that Bando Stone and the New World is a movie, with the studio album serving as a soundtrack. Gambino plays Bando Stone, a singer who discovers his island village is suddenly left deserted. Eventually, he bumps into a woman (played by Jessica Allain) and her child (played by Legend Glover), and they form a traveling party.

> Stone: Okay, woah, woah, woah, stop, stop, stop
> Unidentified Woman: Can you fish?
> Stone: No, no, I can't
> Unidentified Woman: Can you start a fire? Can you hunt?
> Stone (hopeful): I can sing
> Unidentified Woman: You're useless
>
> -- Outro, Steps Beach

And really that's all we know. It's unclear what the next phase of this movie release is, or if it will ever be completed.

## Contentedness

In keeping with the horror/sci-fi element of the movie, a motif through Gambino's lyrics is of blissful satisfaction. Gambino is pleased with his life, stating "All my life I had to try to survive, but it is alright now."

Gambino has fame:

> "Everybody know me, I don't need I.D. (Uh-huh)"
>
> _H3@RT$ W3RE M3@NT T0 F7Â¥_

Gambino has found love:

> "I'ma love you forever
> When there is no together
> There can be no apart"
>
> _We Are God_

Gambino has a child (Legend Glover, who is featured on this song):

> "Heaven on Earth, I don't have to wait
> We made a child, you made a mistake"
>
> _Can You Feel Me (Ft Legend Glover)_

What else could you want? Why mess with anything? Gambino is happy to relax, kick back, and just survive. Gambino wants the listener to join him on his auditory victory lap.

> "Close your eyes
> And share our happiness
> We can all go"
>
> _Got To Be_

## Best Songs:

- In The Night: a slow jam that merges an electric sound with a smooth bassline. Stellar vocals from Gambino and a Jorja Smith feature makes this song my favorite.

- Survive (Ft: Chloe): Gambino reverts to his younger, more aggressive rap persona in this song. This time, it comes with a tinge of nostalgia as he acknowledges just how long he's been an artist.

- Happy Survival (Ft: Khruangbin): In the penultimate song, lyrics take a backseat to vibes in a song that could easily fit in Khruangbin's 2024 album A LA SALA. Driving home the contentedness that defines this album, Gambino gives the listener a song to look up, breath, and just enjoy the moment.

## Final Thoughts:

Upon first listen, I was not a fan of Lil Yachty's tack into indie music with Let's Start Here. Over many listens, it evolved into one of my all time favorites. It proved versatile, and provided the soundtrack to large swaths of my life since then due to its unique approach.

With his final album, Gambino occupies a similar space in my musical rotation. After one listen, I wasn't that interested. It took time to root itself securely in my brain, and it doesn't appear to be leaving anytime soon. I often find myself humming the melody to Steps Beach, or finding the time for an uninterrupted front to back listen.

Authors Note: This album is marketed as Gambino's last album. I'm skeptical, and patient.

## **9.5/10**
