Without a doubt, there's some truth to the awkwardness of Finnish people. They usually don't enjoy small-talk, and are comfortable in silence.

However, while sweating it out in a sauna with a hoarde of Finns, I was able to gain some valuable insight, which I will present to you now. (Mixed in is other lessons from my first week in Finland)

## **Sauna**

Rented for the evening by the CS student organization, this venue had room for 20-30 people in the sauna, and often operated at or above capacity.

Finns love to sing while drinking, but especially in the sauna. A sample of one of the songs:

> Tonight we shall get absolutely f\*\*\*ing hammered (x2)
> Tomorrow we shall have hangovers beyond reason. (x2)

It was during this song I realized just how far from home I was, and how unique this experience is.

## **Students**

Finnish people try to remain a student for as long as possible. It's a cheap lifestyle, and quite enjoyable. The student unions have a lot of power, and are able to subsidize many aspects of student life. Most Finns take 8-10 years in university!

A common sight in Finland is a student jumpsuit. They're colored based on the major, and included custom patches from various events and clubs. They're typically worn exclusively on the bottom half with a belt and the sleeves wrapped around the waist. It's deeply rooted in tradition, and they're worn to school, to parties, and around town; I fear I will be purchasing one very soon...

## **Cellular Data**

Finland has some of the cheapest cell data in Europe, and it's unclear why. Some claim it's a lasting gift from the presence of Nokia in the country. Public wifi is usually pretty slow, and often it's easier to use cellular data instead.

## **Helsinki**

Helsinki is dominated by parks and public transport. Old architecture is astounding and well maintained, new architecture is clean and modern; despite the obvious contrast, no buildings appear out of place. Streetcar tracks take up most of the roadway, and streets are chalk-full of busses.

## **Sport**

Older Finnish people are generally interested in hockey, while their younger counterparts are more interested in soccer. There is also [Pesapallo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDrLcPxSBRk), which is a game invented in 1907 by a guy who went to an American baseball game and then did the best he could to recreate it.

All in all, I'm shocked by how underrated this country is. They really seem to have everything figured out, and how they pay for it all. I highly recommend a visit to Finland. More to come from me later.
