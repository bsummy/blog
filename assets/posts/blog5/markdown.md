## My F1 origin story
My F1 fandom began with the 2021 Azerbijan Grand Prix. I was having a morning coffee and flipped on the TV - moments later, Max Verstappen goes spinning down the fastest section of the F1 calendar after hitting the wall. Without regard for personal safety, he gives the back of his Red Bull car a swift kick and walked across the track.

I'm not quite sure why, but my appreciation for F1 has only grown from there.

If I could guess, I'd think it boils down to three reasons (in no particular order):

1) F1 isn't as much of a tribal "team" sport, it's more of a storyline based series of events. Having a favorite team or driver doesn't dissuade you from enjoying Lando's first win (Miami '24) or a Haas pole position (Brazil '23)
2) F1 is inherently bounded by physics, but the technical regulations allow for engineering delights. Winning in F1 requires good driving, but primarily involves an innovative car.
3) Crofty and Martin Brundle are top of their class in broadcasting.

## My trip to Montreal
Since my roommate Sean lives north of Boston in Wakefield, his father and I set off early on Friday morning to beat the traffic. The drive is a sweeping road north through forests and mountains, until we finally rolled into Montreal around 2.

## F1's class war
Formula 1 is marketed as a sophisticated, European racing series. However, I immediately noticed a discrepency between the public image and the reality. The general public at F1 races are located in large, sketchy, temporary grandstands - packed into hard metal benches during key moments. Regardless, the vibes were exquisite. Its akin to a camping festival since most people wander through the Ile Notre Dame with hiking backpacks.

There's also a "premium" tier of F1. These folks brush elbows with team members in the paddock club, get escorted on/off the island with boats, or get driven around the track in specially outfitted 18 wheelers. (the usual cheers for cars racing around the track was replaced with boos for these 18 wheelers)

All sports have recognized the value of premium experiences and fans, yet the disparity between F1's grandstands and exclusive areas is the largest. I can't help but feel the true F1 experience lies in the grandstands.

## Quali
Sean, John, and I set off early on Saturday to catch free practice 3, a couple hours of supporting races, then F1 qualifying. Montreal doesn't rain often, yet every year storms appear to provide an instant classic race weekend. In this case, Max and George set identical lap times to the thousandth for pole position.

Best of all, Sunday yielded a fight for the lead of the grand prix! A mix of strategies and crashes ultimately resulted in a Max win, but not without a good bit of drama.
