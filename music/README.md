This is a web-app idea that I've had in my head for a while now, and I'm excited to try to bring it to life. I'm not exactly sure of the end product, but it's more a fun deliverable to build. To add a new dimension to my front-end skills, I decided to learn flutter. I first heard about flutter from a stranger I met at Laguardia, who encoraged me to give it a try after he saw me coding. Jason, if you're reading this, thank you for the recommendation.
