## First Impressions
The first leg of my journey has finally begun. My flight got in at 10pm last night, and I immediately learned how small Boston was. By population, Boston is 5 times smaller than Chicago, and about half as big as Montreal.

For those of you who don't know, I'm staying at an MIT frat house for the summer. The rent was super cheap, and it seems like it'll yield some funny stories. It's a block away from the south bank of the Charles River, and its a four story double lot brownstone. Unsurprisingly, it's still a frat house. Trash everywhere, 'bold' design choices, and everything is broken. However, my room is huge and I have three massive windows overlooking the street. It'll do.

It's a good thing I never joined a frat. The house has so much potential - it's a riverfront mansion in Boston. To live here full time would just stress me out to see people treating the place poorly. No disrespect to fraternities, just not for me.

## Sleepless in Boston
Once my brain starts churning, it's impossible for me to go back to sleep - no matter how long I've been asleep. That meant I was up at 4 am today, listening to the house shifting and birds chirping.

Eventually, I gave up trying to rest and went to Target to buy sheets, a pillow, and cleaning supplies.

## Fenway Park
Clearly, there's tons of history around Fenway. Old, beautiful, and well maintained. However, I couldn't shake the fact that its no Wrigley. I'm so upset that I've got to spend all summer working in the 2nd best baseball park in the US. (kidding, of course)

## Sean's House
My uni friend Sean lives just north of Boston, and he's home from MTL for the weekend. I got acquainted with the the T & commuter rail to get out there, and enjoyed a quaint meal with friends. I couldn't imagine a better use of my time.
