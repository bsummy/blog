My older sister Josie visited me in Europe this past week. We had three days in Helsinki, before flying to Stockholm for the weekend. I called upon all the journalist genetics I have from my mom, and gathered quotes from her to include along the way.

Finland is severely underrated by tourists, and I hoped to prove to Josie that her trip to Europe would be worthwhile. (This is a pretty easy task, but still.)

Our trip together began with a visit to a fancy sauna called Loyly (pronounced lowlue). The grounds had four saunas, indoor and outdoor lounge areas, and a space to jump in the Baltic Sea. We saw jellyfish, enjoyed a couple Finnish long drink, and chatted about our respective careers.

Days 2 and 3 were filled with sightseeing in Helsinki. We went together to Suomenlinna, a historic fortress in the Helsinki bay. On the boat, we met another American our age named Sagar. (More on him later).

Josie was a big fan of Oodi, the flagship library in Finland, because the potential for libraries is so high given proper funding.

After soaking up the sun on Oodi's patio, we went to Sompasauna. Sompasauna is a volunteer-run sauna, and it would be totally unrealistic anywhere else in the world. [Sagar and I recently did our part by deep cleaning two saunas after some Finnish guy showed us how] Sompahumans can come and go at will, popping by for 3 different saunas and a swim in the Baltic.

On Friday, we went to Stockholm for the weekend. Josie threw a fit over some raw fish tacos. I had an egg salad and prosciutto breakfast croissant that I'll think about for the rest of my life. We met up with Sagar, who happened to be in Stockholm as well for the weekend. We went to a rooftop bar named Soder, where I asked Sagar to explain the energy industry to me. (Can you imagine a worse drinking buddy than me?) Then, we went to a Herno flagship gin bar which had the gall to serve me a cup of foam as a drink.

In 1628, a Swedish flagship war vessel sank after forgetting to account for the added weight of a second cannon deck. Three hundred years later, they were able to recover the ship from the Baltic and preserve it into the Vasa museum. The museum had auxillary exhibits, but you don't need much else with massive warship in the room - it was enough to just walk around and stare at it from all angles.

> Josie: "I loved the duck, I loved the ribeye, I loved the wine."
> Sagar: "I loved the energy, most of all. I feel very at home here."

Our final meal in Stockholm was at a small-plates Thai place named Pat's Place. The staff feigned a busy night to try and keep us away, but we persisted and it proved well worth it. We sat outside, under heat lamps and blankets, to enjoy 5 dishes and a bottle of Austrian white wine. Sagar said he'd consider returning to Stockholm, just to go back to this restaurant.

P.S. Our parents will be happy to know that there was little sibling bickering on this trip. Josie only got mad at me once, stating "Bennett is putting so much pressure on me to be funny, it feels like I am being held hostage." What can I say? Content is king.
