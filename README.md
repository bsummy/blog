This is a personal blog I created as an alternative to social media. It serves a dual purpose:

a) Update my friends and family to stay up to date on my life. It's totally opt-in, rather than pushing to feeds or sending notifications. I've got a busy year ahead of me, and I want to ensure people have a chance to see what's going on.

b) Improve at front-end design while learning a new paradigm. Here, I have the freedom to build whatever features I feel like, and end up with a nice looking end product. I've already learned so much through building it, and I'll come up with new features to implement as I see fit.
