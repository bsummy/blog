## Bennett in Boston

Roughly one month in, I'm starting to feel more comfortable in Boston. Thankfully, my transition has felt much smoother with a mix of travel and seeing good friends.

Some of the low-ish lights:
- Everything (esp. groceries) is much more expensive in the US than Montreal/Quebec.
- HEAT! (I am a winter guy through and through)
- I love biking and I have no bike. I also love the CTA & the Metro, but the T is almost unusable because it's comparable in time to walking.

Some of the highlights:
- Summertime Montreal! (to see my apartment & roommates/friends)
- My dad visiting for a healthy mix of oysters and walking
- Hanging out with an old friend from highschool who lives in Boston for school
- Learning baseball on a "front office" level & attending games every day.

Disclaimer: Besides little notes, I won't really talk about what I'm doing at work here. I really like it, and I am very thankful for getting to work alongside very kind and skilled people every day.
