Hello again!

We are steamrolling through this semester very quickly. Leaves are changing colors and settling to the ground. There's less and less light every day, and yet somehow the shadows seem different. I'm enjoying myself here in Helsinki.

I turn 22 on Monday, and I've been thinking a lot about what my life will be like a year from now. I truly have no idea; all I know is that I'll go back in December and figure it all out from there. I always do.

Okay, enough with the vaguely sad stuff - I'm sitting in a quiet park at sundown and that evokes all sorts of wistful feelings in me.

I've been trying to ramp up my travel after Josie and I's trip to Stockholm, so I'll do a short review of trips I've been on/have coming up.

## Riga, Latvia:

I never want to "waste" a weekend when everywhere I want to go is so close to me. This was a spontaneous trip with some Danish friends - Mes, Nick, and Astrid.

Riga wasn't stunning as a city, but a great trip nonetheless. Latvia is very cheap, and still felt genuine. Highlight was a four course dinner, cooked in the Danes Airbnb with Latvian items we got at the grocery store.

## Tallinn, Estonia:

My parents came to Helsinki to visit, so we decided to take a two hour cruise on the Baltic to Tallin. Rain put a bit of a dull on the city, but we managed.

I figure I will never go to Estonia again, but it was worth a visit while nearby. My highlight was walking with my dad through the castle quarter overlooking the old city.

## Copenhagen, Denmark:

I then went with my parents to Copenhagen for a long weekend. I'm a big fan of Danes in general, and now I understand a bit more why. Fantastic breads, fashion, architecture, food, and we happened on great weather too. I even managed to get some hockey in; we took a train across the Baltic to Malmo, Sweden for an SHL game.

Walking around the top rim of Kastellet (a star shaped fortress, which is now a park) was my highlight to this trip.

I bought a film camera at a thrift store for a good price - photos from my first batch of film coming soon.

### Upcoming:

- Turku, Finland
- Gothenburg & Stockholm (again), Sweden
- Oslo & Bergen, Norway
- Riga, Latvia (again) & Vilnius, Lithuania
- Tampere, Finland (not planned yet, but hopefully on a day I can see a hockey game)
