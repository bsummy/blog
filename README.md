This is a personal website/blog that I've been working on for a couple weeks. The next year of my life is going to be a busy one, so I decided to create a way for my friend and family to stay up to date. I plan on posting blogs, journal posts, album reviews, assorted thoughts, and more on a totally irregular basis. It'll be totally self-driven, with no notifications or pinging from me.

Upon opening the site, click on any of the albums to check that blog post. Drag the vinyl to the turntable, then press play on the record. The blog post will pop-up, and you can also see pictures from my journey.

I began this project as part of a year-long goal to improve my front-end skills, and to learn the flutter library. Last fall, I met a young father during a layover who first told me about flutter. So, when I starting thinking about an a new project, it seemed like a nice change of pace from the React/Angular and HTML/CSS/JS paradigm.
