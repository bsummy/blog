# **Anton Frondell**:

**10/26 vs Mora J20 & 10/27 vs Leksands J20**

He was wearing an unnamed #52 jersey (his usual number is #14) during my first viewing yesterday. At a level among their peers, the best prospects will usually pop as visibly good while not watching them in isolation.

He was not the only one without a name on his back on Saturday, but I did resolve to figure out who he was after the game - his skill was evident. I eventually found a lineup card, and realized the switch.

There's a calculated casualness about his game that demonstrates his skill. His skating is composed and efficient. His hands, however, are his best attribute. He's got a good deception package while on a rush, and navigates with the puck around defenders with ease.

I saw him thread a backhand pass between defenders to his teammate nearly 60 feet away for a breakaway. I can't say I've seen another player attempt that pass for fear of an interception and being berated by the coach on the bench. It never phased him.

Through two viewings, I did feel a little bit sketched out. He has insane tools, but he wasn't playing the game at the highest level he could. He even put up some nice, highlight points.

To me, he didn't prove beyond reasonable doubt that he was worthy of being at the very top of the draft class. I'm not sure what would rectify what I saw, but I hope he figures it out - he's a talented player.

# **Arvid Drott**:

**10/26 vs Mora J20 & 10/27 vs Leksands J20**

Slightly younger than Frondell, I was more impressed with Drott than Frondell during my first viewing. Drott is an August birthday, placing him only a few weeks before the September 15th cut off for the 2026 draft.

I found him to be more of a play-driver and distributer, though he possesses a hard, accurate wrist shot which didn't compromise release speed.

Willing to dig in physically and not afraid to work through the middle of the ice, even against bigger forwards. I'd like to see if his production can translate to the Allsvenskan this season.

Elite Prospects and early Central Scouting lists put him in the 3rd round. If he continues to play like I saw this weekend, I'd think he goes higher than that.

Projects as a middle six player.

# **Victor Eklund**:

**10/25 vs Bjorklovin (HockeyAllsvenskan)**

I initially thought I'd see Frondell and Eklund together in this game, but little did I know that Frondell had been sent down. I was bummed, but the atmosphere was great, so I was still excited.

Bjorklovin immediately dominated, hopping out to an early lead and maintaining it for most of the game. Eklund was playing off the third line, and clearly gained confidence as the night went on.

In a hat-trick game, the first thing that jumped out to me was a brilliant hit he dropped in the 1st period. I don't think hits matter a ton to winning hockey games, but there's still a traditionalist in me that loves to see it.

As the game got more out of hand, Eklund began to come alive. He began to produce shots and high danger chances at an elite clip, and brought his team back into the game. Coach started calling his number more and more, and the crowd was behind him.

As to his traits, I was obviously most interested by his play creation abilities for himself and for others. He's devilishly quick, and surprised defenders by winning races most players couldn't have. You can't argue the results, but I also couldn't help but feel like there's some stuff in his stride he could iron out. With a posture tweak and more leg drive, he could be even faster.

Top six guy. Even accounting for the bias of a great game, I'd think he goes top ten easily if he keeps it up.

## Also watched:

Theo Stockselius: Didn't see him as a NHL guy. A few nice plays, but he plays too passive.
Viggo Bjorck (2026): smaller forward, but high skill & trusted by the coach. Him and Drott played on the same line and clicked.

## Non-hockey notes:

I bought DIF hats for myself and Hassaan, and I managed to lose mine by the end of the weekend. I am devastated.

Not mentioned was watching Frolunda vs Lulea in Gothenburg. I love the atmosphere around Swedish hockey so much, and it made this game a good time.

The highlight of Gothenburg was taking a ferry over to a Swedish archipelago and hiking around a nature preserve named Galtero. Henry would have loved it.

Fisksoppa (fish soup) in Gothenburg was the culinary highlight of my jaunt around Sweden.
