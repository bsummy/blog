# Hello, World!

I've been home in Chicago for about a month so far after finishing up my school year in April. It was my best semester yet academically, but I also made a lot of time for reading, new friends, and regular coding with [PierreAnalytics](https://www.pierreanalytics.com/about). More on all of that later.

## Chicago
Anyway, during my time in Chicago, I've spent the last couple weeks working on creating this blog. It began as a fun little webapp to learn flutter, and to improve my front end development skills.

My initial plan was to build the goofy little album/turntable thing you see, and then record covers of clips from each album to be played (because I obviously don't have the rights to the real music). However, at some point I pivoted, and began to work on building it into a blog.

I've got a busy year ahead of me, and hopefully be making lots of memories. This blog is a chance to begin to document, and share, some of my experiences.

Without further ado, I'll explain what I've got coming up:

## Boston
After a lengthy interview process with a number of different companies & teams, I successfully landed a job with the Boston Red Sox, working in Baseball Systems. It'll be an amazing opportunity to build off what I learned at the Blackhawks, and see first hand what I've overheard about proprietary baseball platforms from others. I'm also super excited to move to Boston, and see what it's like to work/live in another city.

## Finland
After that, I'll be headed to study at the University of Helsinki in Finland. There's obviously a number of moving parts that I haven't worked out yet, but I plan on traveling as much as possible and filling in the gaps with school. Stockholm, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, and Bergen are all on the agenda. I also intend to get to a couple of SHL, Liiga, and Mestis games to do some live viewings of NHL prospects.

Aron Kiviharju, prepare yourself to be scouted by yours truly.

## Montreal
Then, after that, I'll be back to Montreal to finish up at McGill University. I've got very few credits left, so I'll take only as many classes as I find fascinating. I'll try to simply enjoy my time in Montreal, and deal with graduation and beyond.

I can't wait, and I'm glad you'll be along for the ride.
