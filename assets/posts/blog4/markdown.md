I've got two main housekeeping items to discuss here.

# Homer

I've decided to name this blog homer. It took me a little while of listing out random words in my head to come up with that.

I think it's got a nice dual meaning, and it's easy to say/type.

# Homer: the street

For my entire life, I've lived on the same street in Bucktown. Homer street is a quiet one-way street in the city comprised of workman's homes built in the late 1800s. On summer nights, it's common for a group of Homer St. residents to 'stoop' on a neighbors front porch. Former residents often return to visit our block parties or just say hello. Naming this blog Homer is naturally a reminder of home in Chicago, and something to keep me grounded on my travels.

## Homer: author of epics

Homer is the presumed author of multiple epic poems during ancient Greece. The Iliad is an account of the seige of Troy, and the Odyssey follows Odysseus on his voyage home from the Trojan war. The writing on this website will not be written in dactylic hexameter, nor will it be as coherent. However, I want to use it to stay connected to my friends and family, and as a form of journaling.

## What's going on here:

This website was primarily to build my frontend skills, yet I also have a couple fun ideas for posts. Most of my posts will be written blog posts detailing my journey through Boston, Montreal, Finland, and wherever else I end up.

However, I have a couple of fun ideas for posts:

- Hockey deep-dives or scouting reports
- Album reviews
- Book reviews
- Photo galleries (no blog post, only photos with captions)
- Cooking Recipes
- Tech talks for new features on this site, or for [PierreAnalytics](https://www.pierreanalytics.com/about)
- Whatever else I come up with!

I also plan on including a "Soundtrack" section on some posts, where I'll share the albums/songs I've been listening to.

## Why did I build it this way:

In recent years, I've been extremely anti-social media. I want my screen-time to be additive to my life, instead of a waste of time. Social media depends on a fear of missing out on information - in reality, it results in us in missing out on real life. I decided to significantly cut back on media, and fill that time with reading and skill acquisition.

I do want to offer a way to stay in touch with me. It is intentionally designed without notifications or any noise. Put simply, if you want to use it, you can.

# Yes, this could absolutely be an email blast, but where's the fun in that??
