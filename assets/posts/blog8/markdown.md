# **Montreal Style Potato Chowder**

Amy loves this soup.

I believe that all recipes are guardrails, not instructions. Every time I make it, I look at a couple different recipes and take the components I like. This is my best guess as to the "official" recipe; take it as such and make your own improvements.

**Ingredients**

Most ingredients can be easily varied. More or less bacon, milk, veggies, is all acceptable.

- 1 pack of bacon - chopped
- 1 large yellow onion, or 2 smaller onions - chopped
- 3+ garlic cloves (minced)
- 2 1/2 lbs gold potatoes - chopped into bite-sized cubes
- 1/3 cup of flour
- 4 cups chicken broth (or 32 oz chicken broth carton)
- 2 cups milk
- 2/3 cup half and half
- 1 tsp salt (more to taste)
- 1 tsp pepper (more to taste)
- 1 8 oz can of corn - drained
- (optional garnishes): shredded cheddar cheese, sour cream dollop, chopped chives, Franks Hot Sauce

**Instructions**

1. Cook chopped bacon in a large soup pot until lightly browned.
2. Remove bacon from the pot, leaving the bacon fat. Eat a couple bits of bacon for a fun snack.
3. Add chopped onion and cook until onion softens (~4 mins)
4. Add garlic and cook until garlic is fragrant (30 seconds)
   - Note: cooked garlic is key to creating an olfactory illusion of good cooking.
5. Add flour and stir to distribute.
6. Before the garlic browns or burns completely, add the broth, milk, half and half, salt, and pepper. Stir well.
7. Cook until the potatoes are tender. Cooking time will vary based on the temperature of the milks/broth you added. My guess would be 10-20 minutes.
8. Pour approximately half the soup into a blender, blend, then return to the pot. This does magic for the texture, and I do not recommend skipping it.
9. Add corn and bacon back to the pot.
10. Taste the soup.
    - Too thick or too creamy? Add broth.
    - Too thin? Add flour.

Tweak anything else you want. Add garnishes.

If it tastes bad, blame the chef. Let me know and I'll make it for you the right way.
